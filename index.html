<h1>Wtf?</h1>

<p>
Previously <a href="https://twitter.com/bitemyapp">I</a> had a caricature of the negative infighting and position-taking in the Haskell community here. I wrote this primarily to cheer up two people who are saddened by the FTP debate--one of them on the Haskell dot org committee, both of them Haskell users that want to see the language improve. I succeeded, then requested that the Reddit post & user account I made for it be deleted because it was not my intention to add to the strife and negativity.

If you were one of the people that got a kick out of it, I'm glad. If not, well, one can't please all the people all the time.
